## Analysis

### 1. Number of Records
People seem to cycle more in the summer than in the winter. The possible reason could be that people are unwilling to ride outside in winter due to cold weather.
October 2019 had the highest number of registrations, while February and April 2020 had a zero record probably due to the outbreak of covid.

### 3. Peak Hours
(8:00 a.m. and 5:00-6:00 p.m.) seem to be peak times for runners.
In summer, more people cycle in the evening than in the morning, but in winter, more people cycle in the morning than in the evening.

### 4. Trip Distance and Duration by Age
In terms of distance and duration, it is clear that young people between the ages of 25 and 30 cover greater distances, while older people cover longer durations. We also see that people in their fifties are in the majority in terms of the number of registrations
